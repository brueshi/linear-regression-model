Linear regression is a simple and widely used statistical model for predicting a continuous target variable based on one or more input features. The model assumes a linear relationship between the input features and the target variable, where the target variable is a weighted sum of the input features plus an intercept term.

The model is expressed as:

y = b0 + b1x1 + b2x2 + ... + bnxn

where:

y is the target variable
x1, x2, ..., xn are the input features
b0 is the intercept term
b1, b2, ..., bn are the coefficients for each input feature
The goal of linear regression is to find the values of b0, b1, ..., bn that minimize the difference between the predicted values and the actual values of the target variable. This is typically done by minimizing the sum of squared errors between the predicted values and the actual values using a technique called least squares regression.

Once the model is trained, it can be used to make predictions for new data points by plugging in the values of the input features. Linear regression is a popular and powerful tool for tasks such as predicting stock prices, estimating sales, and analyzing trends in data.
